# 👻 SpecterOps – AI Agent Exorcist

### _A Haunted Autonomous DevOps Control Center_

SpecterOps is an **AI-powered CI/CD pipeline** that decides which “ghost deployments” deserve to live in production or be banished back to the void.

### 🧩 How It Works
| Step | Agent | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| 🚀 **DeployAgent** | Summons a new canary (ghost) build. |
| 📈 **MonitorAgent** | Observes its vitality and records metrics. |
| ⚖️ **Exorcist (GovernorAgent)** | Uses AI logic to decide: if the ghost is strong → promoted to production (🎉 confetti); if weak → banished (💀 ashes). |

### 💀 Tech Stack
- **React + Vite** – Frontend UI
- **Netlify Functions** – Serverless backend logic
- **Raindrop SmartMemory** – Shared agent state (mocked locally)
- **canvas-confetti** – Visual feedback for ghost promotion & banishment
- **Netlify AI Gateway (optional)** – AI decision-making layer

### ⚡ Quick Start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
